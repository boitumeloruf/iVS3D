     * @param pyrScale parameter, specifying the image scale (<1) to build pyramids for each image; pyr_scale=0.5 means a classical pyramid, where each next layer is twice smaller than the previous one.
     * @param fastPyramids uses a faster calculation for
     * @param winSize averaging window size; larger values increase the algorithm robustness to image noise and give more chances for fast motion detection, but yield more blurred motion field.
     * @param numIters number of iterations the algorithm does at each pyramid level
     * @param polyN size of the pixel neighborhood used to find polynomial expansion in each pixel; larger values mean that the image will be approximated with smoother surfaces, yielding more robust algorithm and more blurred motion field, typically poly_n =5 or 7.
     * @param polySigma standard deviation of the Gaussian that is used to smooth derivatives used as a basis for the polynomial expansion; for poly_n=5, you can set poly_sigma=1.1, for poly_n=7, a good value would be poly_sigma=1.5.
     * @param flags - OPTFLOW_USE_INITIAL_FLOW uses the input flow as an initial flow approximation.
