/**
 * @interface IAlgorithm
 *
 * @ingroup Plugin
 *
 * @brief The IAlgorithm interface is used to include plugin implementations for different sampling algorithms. As such the plugins need to present a display name
 * and have the possibility to display a custom QWidget to the user. The main task for a IAlgorithm plugin to select keyframes based on the given images. This is
 * performed in sampleImages. Images are accessible by the Reader object. The currently selected images are apssed as indices in imageList. This allows the plugin
 * to sample on the current image selection as well as include intermediate images in the computation. The plugin can write data to an QVariant in order to buffer them.
 * Buffered data is managed by the core application and is passed to the plugin on the next sampleImages call.
 *
 * For implementation examples see NthFrame, Blur and Rotation.

     * @brief sampleImages selects the keyframes from the given images. The computation is based on the images provided by the given Reader. The imageList

     * can be very timeconsuming, it is recommended to report progress to the given Progressable by invoking Progressable::slot_makeProgress. It should be
     * possible to abort calculation by setting the value of stopped to @a true. Therefore it is necessary to repeatedly check its state. To speedup calculation,
     * data can be buffered to accelerate the next call of sampleImages. On some systems the gpu can be utalized for acceleration as well, but only if useCuda is
