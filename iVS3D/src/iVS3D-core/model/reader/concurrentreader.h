/**
 * @class ConcurrentReader
 *
 * @ingroup Model
 *
 * @brief The ConcurrentReader class is a wrapper for a Reader object. The ConcurrentReader can be moved to a separate thread to
 * read images in parallel. The images can be requested using ConcurrentReader::slot_read. The reader sends the signal
 * ConcurrentReader::sig_imageReady if the image is loaded. Since usually requests for images from the gui thread comi in much
 * faster than they can be handled by the Reader, the ConcurrentReader collects blocks incoming requests and only passes the latest
 * read request to the Reader. This ensures that on slower hardware and with higher resolution images always the most recent image
 * is loaded and send to the gui.
